- **Profile Management:**
    - **Import/Export:** Easily import and export your entire application profile (including servers, subscriptions, and settings) as a single JSON file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Download and Run (For Users)

You don't need Python installed to use Onix. Simply download the latest executable (EXE) from the [Releases](https://github.com/AhmadAkd/onix/releases) section on GitHub.

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/AhmadAkd/onix/releases).
2. Find the latest release and download the `onix-windows-exe.zip` file.
3. Extract the ZIP file.
4. Run the `onix.exe` file.

**Note:** The `sing-box.exe` file is automatically downloaded and managed by Onix, so you do not need to download it separately.

### For Developers

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AhmadAkd/onix.git
    cd onix
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Linux/macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### Running the Application

When you run the application for the first time, it will automatically download the latest version of `sing-box.exe` for your operating system.

```bash
python main.py
```

## üì¶ Building the Executable (EXE)

To build a standalone Windows executable (EXE) using PyInstaller:

1. Ensure all development prerequisites are met (like `pyinstaller`).
2. Simply run the `build.bat` script by double-clicking it.

The script will automatically handle all steps, and the final executable (`onix.exe`) will be created in the `dist` folder.

  - **Sortable Headers:** Click "Name" or "Ping" to sort the list.
  - **Server List:** Shows the servers within the selected group. Click on a server to select it. Right-click for more options.
  - **Start/Stop Buttons:** To start or stop the Sing-box connection.
  - **Status Bar:** Displays the current connection status, IP address, and latency.
- **Management Panel (Right Panel):**
  - **Subscription Management:** Manage and update your subscription links.
  - **Group Actions:** Ping all servers, perform URL tests, or cancel ongoing tests.
